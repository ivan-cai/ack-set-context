Use this GitHub Action to [set context for Kubernetes cluster of Alibaba Cloud Kubernetes (ACK)](https://www.aliyun.com/product/kubernetes) or [set context for cluster of Alibaba Distributed Cloud Container Platform for Kubernetes (ACK One)](https://www.aliyun.com/product/aliware/adcp).

    ## optional, supports 'ACK' or 'ACKOne', default is 'ACK'
    cluster-type: '<cluster type>'
    access-key-id: '<access key id>'
    access-key-secret: '<access key secret>'
